Here's the slides for my intro to F# presentation. The presentation is written in F# and then compiled to javascript by the 
wonderful [Fable](http://fable.io/) F# to JS compiler. The presentation framework is [FsReveal](https://fsprojects.github.io/FsReveal/), 
which is based on [RevealJs](https://revealjs.com/#/). You can find the 
[source fsx file](https://github.com/codehutch/codehutch.github.io/blob/source/Other/Fable2/README.md) (fsharp script file) on github
along with the rest of the source files for this blog. Easiest way to navigate through the slides is to **click into the presentation** 
then **keep pressing Space** to move through the slides in sequence (and press **Escape** to see a map if you get lost).
