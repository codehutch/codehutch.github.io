    Intended Purpose

</h5>

<p>

	This blog is here to share some love for the particularly fine functional programming language,
	<a href=http://www.fsharp.org>F#</a>


	C# / Java - like writing an essay.
	F# / Scala - like writing a poem / song lyrics (actually nothing like that, but quicker to get your point accross).
	             Mainly because the type-system is more flexible

	Trying to get better at drawing

	Go one paragraph. Have 2/3 text and 1/3 images, every paragraph. Use dave^2 image convertion to svg.

	Link on H1 to home.
	Link to blog source.

	Fix root domain forwarding. Delete and reapply.

	This needs finishing....
