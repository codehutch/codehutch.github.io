**Literate _Markdown stuff_ etc**
---------------------------------

This file demonstrates how to write Markdown document with 
embedded `F# codey` snippets that can be transformed into nice HTML 
using the `literate.fsx` script from the [F# Formatting
package](http://tpetricek.github.com/FSharp.Formatting).

In this case, the document itself is a valid Markdown and 
you can use standard Markdown features to format the text:

 - Here is an example of unordered list and...
 - Text formatting including **bold** and _emphasis_

For more information, see the [Markdown][md] reference.

### _Writing **F#** code_ ###

In standard Markdown, you can include code snippets by 
writing a block indented by four spaces and the code 
snippet will be turned into a `<pre>` element. If you do 
the same using Literate F# tool, the code is turned into
a nicely formatted F# snippet:

##### Some code

    /// The Hello World of functional languages!
    let rec factorial x = 
      if x = 0 then 1 
      else x * (factorial (x - 1))

    let f10 = factorial 10


#### _Hiding **code**_ ####

If you want to include some code in the source code, 
but omit it from the output, you can use the `hide` 
command. You can also use `module=...` to specify that 
the snippet should be placed in a separate module 
(e.g. to avoid duplicate definitions).

    [hide, module=Hidden]
    /// This is a hidden answer
    let answer = 42

The value will be deffined in the F# code that is 
processed and so you can use it from other (visible) 
code and get correct tool tips:

    let answer = Hidden.answer

### _Including **other** snippets_ ###

When writing literate programs as Markdown documents, 
you can also include snippets in other languages. 
These will not be colorized and processed as F# 
code samples:

    [lang=csharp]
    Console.WriteLine("Hello world!");

This snippet is turned into a `pre` element with the
`lang` attribute set to `csharp`.
